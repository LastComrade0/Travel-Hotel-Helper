The only complaint I had was the air freshener used in the room. It needs to be toned down quite a bit as our clothes even smelled of the scent.

I didn’t know about this ahead of time so I was disappointed. The hotel cleaning staff was SO TERRIBLY LOUD in the morning that they woke me up daily. Not a lot of noise insulation.

It was my job to arrange for the hotel and car. I have used Expedia on several occasions to book or reserve the things needed for my trips. I\'m satisfied with Expedia but not with this Hotel at all. Although we were greeted in  a professional manner we soon learned of the problems with our rooms. The trim paneling for the door was missing on one side, a light bulb was burnt out and the room was dusty as soon by a large amount of dust which had accumulated around the vents. My friend who is elderly and disabled found very quickly that the main door lock to his room was malfunctioning. Upon calling the front desk they came up and had to toggle both the inner and outer handles to get the door to close. They didn\'t fix the problem only blamed it on a malfunction and showed my friend how to proceed from there on out. At 3:33 am the fire alarm went off due to a broken hot water line. We got no sleep so it didn\'t make for a very good day!

It was dark and there were homeless people everywhere. The hotel security came out to the car to escort us inside. The hotel itself is an older building that has been restored. Overall, a very cute place. The rooms are small with very limited storage. I had to leave the suit cases out all week because there is zero room in the closet. Drawer storage was equivalent to two night stand drawers. The bathroom itself was tiny and needs to be redone. Overall it was mainly just worn. \r\n\r\nWhile the hotel in conveniently located just two blocks from Union Sqare, it\'s a rough two blocks. We made sure that we were back inside before dark each night. Even during the day the walk is dirty and smells strongly of urine. In addition you will encounter many homeless individuals asking for money about every 20 feet. \r\n\r\nThe hotel staff was friendly. We never asked for much to really rate their quality. The $30 amenity fee was a joke. Really you are paying $30 for wireless access and flavored water in the lobby. There is a restaurant and bar attached to the hotel, but it was open limited hours. The drinks that we had from there were fine, but we didn\'t feel that the menu had many options.

This Holiday Inn is one of the best I\'ve stayed at, with newer facilities, a restaurant, bar, and convenient (albeit pricey) parking. $37 a night to park but that\'s expected in the big city.\r\n\r\nThe room was nice with a cool view of San Fran, right in the heart of the Civic Center area. This is pretty centrally located to anywhere you want to go, which was great for my girlfriend and I. The room came with a Keurig coffee (we had a King Bed room) and was very clean. Seemed like it had been renovated recently. Staff was very friendly, check-in was kind of a wait but what can you do? Plus, their vending machines for pop only cost $1.50. When is the last time that happened?\r\n\r\nThe walls are a bit thin, so if you\'re offended by late-night/early-morning love-making, maybe get some earplugs or check elsewhere.

After chilly/windy days touring around the city, this was not an ideal situation to come back to. I let the front desk know, and she said she would let maintenance know. No one followed up with us, and it didn\'t get fixed. After our second round of ice cold showers the next day, we went back down to the front desk and spoke with a woman who told us that it was going to be looked into and that they had been having problems with their boiler. It wasn\'t until we asked for the manager to call us directly (since the front desk staff provided us with no help or answers), that we were given an apology. The manager did offer a small reimbursement, but that didn\'t fix our problem! Our water problem was ice cold our entire stay. Thankfully we were only there three nights.\r\nIn addition, after we had been storing items in our fridge, we learned that it hadn\'t been working.\r\nMy husband and I are very flexible and easy going people, but we would not stay at this hotel again.

The hallways/elevators had a rustic feel to them, which, in my mind, let me know this building has some history behind it. All-wood floors, so if you don\'t like creaky floors then be advised. All-in-all, the rooms were clean, cozy, and great for an on-the-go tourist. When you needed to come in from your long day of walking & spending money, your room awaits for some TV watching, and winding down.

The bathroom lacked flash and was just ok (old school bathtub with shower curtain and small).  No private toilet here so be ready to be intimate with your roommate.

The room we had (Superior Room, 1 Queen Bed) was definitely not the biggest hotel room as we read in some reviews, but we did not plan on spending a ton of time in the room anyways.  There was definitely enough space for what you need (small walk-in and lots of storage under the bed).  The bed was honestly one of the comfiest beds we have ever slept in!    Bathroom was tiny but again, all you need and very clean.  Our room was ready when we arrived in San Fran around 11am which was awesome and staff was great. Location wise, it is right by everything you need (transit, restaurants and shopping).  There are homeless people honestly anywhere you go in San Fran - one street is good then another is a tad shady.  We were not bothered by any of them right by the hotel.  A minor downside to the hotel is the elevator.  As the hotel has an older feel which I really liked, the elevator is quite tiny and very slow which can be a negative if you have a big group or lots of luggage or are older.

We immediately called the front desk and told them. As there were no other rooms available at the time, they offered to clean the carpet as we decided to go out for a stroll around Union Square. When we returned, the smell was replaced by something more pleasant but the odor returned after a few hours. We decided to just avoid that space since we only needed to pass it when entering or exiting the room. A lot of the room fixtures are in disrepair and the bathroom was oddly shaky as well. Cleanliness was not a strongpoint as dirt was visibly accumulated on the door hinges and when I went to rest for the evening and looked at the ceiling, there was a huge clump of dust around one of the ceiling fixture covers.

We had a nice little corner view of the bay bridge! It seems like the amenities in the room have been upgraded recently. The thing that could have been better is the water pressure in the shower but overall it was a great stay. The location is pretty good. Let\'s be honest SF has a huge homeless problem and in the financial district there are considerably less than union square and the sort. The hotel was withing walking distance of the piers and markets near the bay bridge and made for a nice walk down. There are coffee shops all around this hotel. If you are looking to go out at night the Uber rides will cost you around 20 dollars to get to the popular local bars, so not bad. One thing to note about parking is there is a parking garage on battery street withing a 30 second walk of the hotel. I think it was $34 dollars for 24 hours but I got it for $25 (no in and out privilege however) using an app called spot hero. The valet at the hotel charges $65 and parks in the same structure (they do allow in and out). We got the hotel on a deal for around $250 and considering how expensive all of the hotels in SF are I would consider this hotel a good deal and would stay here again.','2016-07-14',NULL,0),('5787cbb4bbce6e0b28ead811',21073,4,'Stylish Hotel Experience Near Union Square','Chris','Clift is a stylish, contemporary, hotel in a great location.

You may have a certain level of anxiety staying there.  In order to increase security, though, they have installed many, bright security lights.  You should expect to see many people there with various backgrounds.  The walls in the room are painted in a stucco fashion.  The carpet in my room has seen better days.  The bathroom was ok except for the placement of the bathroom tissue holder (very inconvenient).  The cleaning staff made the bed but afterward did not want to replace the thin, decorative bed accent at the foot of the bed.  Also, they changed the towels but were regularly reluctant to empty the trash or vacuum the floors as necessary.  I did, however, see someone spot check some of the rooms.  Moreover, as in other posts, I smelled cigarette and other smoke that came into my room although all windows and doors were closed.  So, while you may have asked for a non-smoking room, you may come into contact with it anyway.  Additionally, I had to request an ironing board but received a small ironing board that lays on the bed.  You should, moreover, expect to pay the full costs of your stay at the time of check-in.

Fine, no outstanding amenities.  The building felt old, and not updated anytime recently.\r\n\r\nDay 1 - The mini-fridge had a solid rattle which kept me up at night, needed to unplug it.

It had one knob, off when pointing straight up.  If you turned it to the right, you got cold water.  To the left, hot water.  But no way to get warm water.

When I asked about the wifi fee, they comped it. When I struggled with the coffee maker, a new one was sent up immediately.  You are going to pay exorbitant amounts while staying in hotels in the San Fran/Napa/Sonoma area, at least here I got my $ worth.','2016-07-26',NULL,0),('579775bb3a803a0b289a5906',8737,4,'Close to shopping.

Are the amenities mentioned on your website all available? The valet person working all week would get into arguments with the front desk people every single time I saw him. This made me uncomfortable with him handling a rental car I was responsible for. The front desk staff were all great. There is even a amazing Mexican place and Starbucks directly connected to this hotel. I think once all their construction is complete it could be kinda cool, but unfortunately we had a terrible experience due to the construction. The bathroom in our room was tiny.

The sound from my tv kind of covered over the next room\'s tv sound. 2. The bath tub was slow in draining, so it was partially clogged down the line somewhere.

The whole seventh floor was suppose to be evacuated but not a single staff member were to be found on seventh floor.  When all of us managed to make it downstairs to Main lobby, No one knew what was going on except one person at front desk.  We waited in the lobby for almost an hour just to find out that it was false alarm.  If this is a high class hotel, then what is security doing?  Some one pulled the fire alarm and ran with out the security catching them?  After all of that drama, right at 9:00 AM, room cleaning staff kept knocking on my door.  Even though the check out time is not until 12 noon.  She knocked for good 3 minutes until I finally woke and managed to open the door and tell her that we are not checking out until 12 noon.  Did not sleep that night.

It was fine, but The staff should probably consider opening windows on the upper floor or investing in some air fresheners.  Also, if you need something, the front desk does not answer the phone.  You need to go downstairs and speak directly to them.

I had tickets to a concert that needed to be printed out.  My buddy took care of calling the front desk, sending them the email, and walking up there to have it printed out.  The staff person had serious printer trouble (needed new toner cartridge, etc) and after three or four attempts, finally got a clean printout (so bar codes were legible and could be scanned).  Then the staff person told my buddy \"maybe next time we not do this for you;\" to which my buddy replied \"maybe next time we not stay here.\"  I will say that housekeeping did a good job of cleaning the room each day that we were there, and the location was pretty good for SF.

Unfortunately our stay was ruined by two poor policy decisions by the hotel management.  On check-in, I made it clear I was using a debit card and was assured that no deductions would be made during \"pre-authorization\". This was untrue as $100 was immediately deducted and after we spent more than the $100 on a meal, not only was another $100 deducted but also the cost of the meal as well.  We now had over $300 not available on our debit card. We are assured it will be returned - in 5 days.  So my advice - do not use a debit card in this hotel even when you\'re told it will be OK.  The second is the Free WiFi fine print. The hotel advertises that free wifi is available. They don\'t tell you that it is NOT available free to Expedia bookings!! Expedia clients get one hour free wifi - only in the lounge, only for one device per room and only once per stay - seriously.  Free wifi is only available to loyalty program members, corporate clients and people who book directly thru the hotel website.  None of this is made clear anywhere until arrival. Free WiFi should be available in all hotels and for this hotel to gouge its Expedia clients in this way is unforgivable.  If you get caught like we did, persist with your request for free wifi and the staff will eventually provide an access code! Also allow an hour to checkout!

Many positives such as free parking, clean rooms, quiet--albeit it was near the airport, our room #327 had a wonderful view of the bay and we could watch the jets take off and land, excellent paved walking/jogging path that goes up and down the bay.  \r\n\r\nFree breakfast, but some breakfast items one needed to heated or reheated with the microwave as they were preprocessed frozen items ie bacon, sausage patty, omelets, ham, & a hash-brown potato wedge.   They did have three waffle irons for fresh made waffles.  Plenty of sliced and diced fruit and hot oatmeal.  Four different juice options and hot coffee. Their breakfast is nowhere as good as one\'s done by Embassy Suites, but it wasn\'t horrible either.   I just stayed away from the items one needed to zap in the microwave.    The breakfast dinning area is also small and congested.  Overall their breakfast was OK, but that is a good thing as I didn\'t overeat.    \r\n\r\nOur room was extremely clean and spacious.  Beds were a bit small but comfortable.  They could have placed another bed or sofa couch in there to occupy the open \"dead\" space as the room had too much un-utilized space.  I recommend that they replace the their double sized beds with queens or king sized ones.  To be fair, they may have had rooms with double queens, but this room was the only one available for us when we booked.  \r\n\r\nBottom line---We would stay here again.

The view we got was a white building across the street... I did not know that is considered a view nowadays. The room i stayed in was room 562 which was extremely small and the beds were barely full size.  I guess for SF that is considered rather large. The room states that it sleeps up to four people but only provides the room with 2 large white towels in the shower. The next morning when the cleaning crew came they knocked once and did not wait for people in the room to respond before entering. Perhaps that was our fault that we did not put the DO NOT DISTURB at 7AM sign on the door first. But seriously, as a courtesy, please at least wait a few seconds for people to answer before entering. Also, there was construction going on at the hotel so noises starts at 6AM. on the plus side, there is a Starbucks coffee on the first floor but don\'t expect free coffee for guests.

There\'s a lobby community space with couches and a flat screen, a dining hall that functions as an impromptu drinking spot at night, vending machines that sell instant food, cords, and other sundries (condoms?...nah, too family oriented), a couple hang-out rooms disguised as meeting rooms when you have to video conference, but don\'t want to from your room, and a breakfast buffet where cereal is the highlight. Then there\'s the typical business hotel spaces: a room with a PC and printer, a fitness center with a couple machines, and a pool. Everything here is DIY: guests taxi their own bags with luggage carts, do thier own laundry in the coin-operated machines or the bathtub, and make their own meals using the in-room kitchen stocked with pots, dishes, tableware, dish soap, etc. This place is compatible for the independent type who doesn\'t want a hotel to dictate how they stay, or how much they spend on overpriced hotel meals, but don\'t expect high-end or luxury for the high prices.  Not quite a hotel, a house, or a hostel, but trying to be everything simultaneously.

It\'s an adult style B&B that is calm, peaceful, mature & relaxing.

It was more than enough room for all of us. Everything was clean and well maintained. And of course, the breakfast was wonderful. The full breakfast was why we chose Comfort Inn. We also liked that the stairs were well lit and seemed like they were a part of the hotel not just an emergency exit. We are a family that would much rather take the stairs rather than an elevator, so not having to go out of our way or in some dark, dirty back stairwell was very welcomed.','2013-12-03',NULL,0),('63344943',1145267,5,'','','','2013-12-16',NULL,0),('63347882',894295,3,'','','','2013-12-16',NULL,0),('63732229',519729,5,'MOTHER / DAUGHTER GET AWAY !!!!','','We had a great stay here - AGAIN.

Was better than I expected. I anticipated getting a room with a view to the lake but those were all booked. The girl at check in was very nice and put us in a room away from the train tracks to compensate and we got a partial lake view which was still very nice. It was quiet and calm away from the city noise but a close 7 min drive into downtown. The beds were not the softest but still we were able to get a goodnight sleep.

Close to the Airport.','Brian','We chose the Comfort Inn because of it\'s close location to the San Francisco Airport. We came off a cruise and wanted to stay 1 extra day to do a bit of touring. We arrived at Comfort Inn at approximately 9 a.m. and they stored our luggage for us and off we went touring. When We came back about 3 p.m. we checked in. They upgraded us from a King Bed Standard room to a King Bed Suite which was a pleasant surprise. Our 1 night stay was enjoyable. Everyone must remember when You stay at a Hotel near an Airport You will hear Airplanes occasionally. It did not bother us.\nWe got a free breakfast in the morning and free shuttle bus to the Airport.','2014-04-30',NULL,0),('70709508',519729,5,'Easy, pleasant stay','','The room was clean.

We made tge mistake of waiting at the wrong covered bus stop area and when we saw the shuttle pass our station and slow down at the best one. But apparently, when the driver didn\'t see anyone directly under the bus stop, he didn\'t bother to even come to a full stop. He then just took off to other next terminal.
